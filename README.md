# Arcade Fighting game using Object Oriented techniques

This project was an experiment to make an arcade fighting game in Javascript, when I was figuring out how to make game mechanics in on fixed 2D game canvas.
Those Mechanics are common to most retro arcade games on consoles: gravity, game world constraints, animation triggersm hitbox detection and hit points of the characters.
It is not a finished project but a good starting point for a 2D platformer or scrolling fighting game. 

The controls are desktop keyboard based:
WASD keys to move
Space bar to jump
Enter to attack
