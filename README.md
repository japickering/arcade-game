# Arcade Fighting game using Object Oriented techniques

This project was an experiment to make an arcade fighting game in Javascript completely from scratch, when I was figuring out how to make game mechanics on a 2D game canvas.
Those mechanics are common to most retro arcade video games: gravity, game world constraints, collision detection, animation triggers and hitboxes and hit points.

It is not a finished project but a good starting point for an arcade game with combat elements.

The controls are desktop keyboard based:
WASD keys to move
Space bar to jump
Enter to attack
